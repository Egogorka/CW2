[ ] user addition for an attack // CWWT

    [ ] think about the design, mby window with form?
    [ ] also implement that design

[Х] HexCoordinate rework // CWWT(mby?)

    [Х] think if I really need that (but Point class both for points(vectors) and hexes? bruh..)
    [Х] and why the fuck offset coordinates involve +1/2

    [Х] AxialCoordinate
        [Х] itself
        [Х] methods (some of them, like distance)

    [Х] OffsetCoordinate
        [Х] find the reason of it's existence
